**- allow array variables at places like for loop iterator, array indexes, etc. Merge number and variable together as value containing atom.
**- see where a NUMBER can be replaced by variable
**- find some solution to accept empty block e.g. empty loop block or codeblock or declblock
**- check for special characters in string literal
**- modulo operator
**- multiple unary minuses are not giving error e.g.  ----x  [solved]  It's a valid syntax
*- assignment operator needs to be declared outside expression
- enum for relational operator
- check for proper if else pairing


- make separation between variable in decl_block and variable in code_block
