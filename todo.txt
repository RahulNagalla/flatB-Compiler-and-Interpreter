- allow array variables at places like for loop iterator, array indexes, etc
- see where a NUMBER can be replaced by variable
- find some solution to accept empty block e.g. empty loop block or codeblock or declblock


- multiple unary minuses are not giving error e.g.  ----x  [solved]  It's a valid syntax
